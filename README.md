# CT-Corpus

This repository contains:

## Annotated corpus
The corpus comprises 211 annotated clinical trial abstracts to support schema-based (i.e., template slot-filling) relational information extraction.
The schema followed for the annotation relies on the C-TrO ontology for the aggregation of clinical trials. The [SANTO](https://github.com/ag-sc/SANTO) tool for schematic annotation was used.
The annotated abstracts are of published clinical trials on glaucoma and type 2 diabetes mellitus available at PubMed. 
The corpus and the annotation guidelines are under the **Data** directory.

## Code
The code for the inter-annotation agreement calculation and the baseline method to recognize single entities. The code can be found under the **Code** directory.
