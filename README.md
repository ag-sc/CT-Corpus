# CT-Corpus

This repository contains:

## Annotated corpus
The corpus contais 211 annotated clinical trial abstracts to support schema-based (i.e., template slot-filling) relational information extraction.
The schema followed for the annotation relies on the C-TrO ontology for the aggregation of clinical trials.
The annotated abstracts are of published clinical trials on glaucoma and type 2 diabetes mellitus available at PubMed. 

## Code
The code for the inter-annotation agreement calculation and the baseline method to recognize single entities.
